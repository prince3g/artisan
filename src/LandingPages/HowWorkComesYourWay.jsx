                <article className="membership">
                    <h2>1. Choose a Membership that Brings Leads Straight to You</h2>
                    <p>
                        Start by selecting a membership plan that matches your goals. The best platforms connect you directly with homeowners or business owners who are actively searching for your services. Once you are part of a trusted platform, people in your area can find you and see your work. This gives you a head start, as clients already know your skills match their needs.

                    <p>
                        When customers search for tradespeople, they’ll often check out profiles to get a feel for the work quality. Here’s what you should include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Photos of Past Projects:</strong> Capture before-and-after shots or unique pieces you’re proud of. Visuals show your skills and help clients imagine your work for their needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Great Reviews:</strong> Ask happy clients to leave honest feedback on your profile. Positive reviews build trust quickly and show that you’re reliable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional Liability Insurance (PLI):</strong> Displaying proof of insurance can reassure clients that you’re ready to handle jobs professionally. Although optional for some trades, it’s a big plus that can set you apart.</li>

                    <h2>3. Easy Contact Methods for Clients</h2>
                    <p>The easier it is for customers to reach you, the more likely they’ll choose you. Here’s how work will start coming your way:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Direct Calls:</strong> Clients can call you directly to discuss their projects, giving you a chance to introduce yourself and understand their needs right away.</li>
                        <li><strong>Messaging Option:</strong> Some clients prefer sending a message first. Keep an eye on your messages so you can reply quickly. Customers appreciate responsiveness, and it may give you an edge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Trade Contacts:</strong> Platforms often let homeowners contact more than one trade professional. Stand out by being professional, prompt, and clear in your responses. Customers often choose traders who make them feel comfortable and informed from the start.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Local Recommendations & Good Standing</h2>
                    <p>
                        For Nigerian tradespeople, especially those in close-knit communities, local word-of-mouth and associations can be powerful. If you’re well-regarded in your neighbourhood, clients are more likely to trust you. When clients see a history of satisfied customers, they’re far more likely to reach out to you first. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach can turn your profile into a magnet for jobs, helping you build a reputation that brings in steady work. So, make sure you keep your profile current, show your best work, and maintain open lines of communication. With the right mix of visibility and professional presentation, you’ll stand out to the homeowners and business owners looking for your skills.
