        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to SimserviceHub! Our mission is to connect our customers with
          verified and trusted tradespeople across Nigeria. By using our
          platform, customers can search for, find, and contact tradespeople in
          their local area, while tradespeople can showcase and offer their
          professional services to customers.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 Who We Are</h3>
        <p>
          1.1.1 The platform is provided to you by us, Simul Management
          Solutions, trading as ‘SimserviceHub’. Our registered office is at
          Plot 9, Gbagada Industrial Scheme, beside UPS, Gbagada-Oworonshoki
          Expressway, Lagos, Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.1.2 For the purposes of these terms, “SimserviceHub,” “we,” “us,” or
          “our” refers to Simul Management Solutions, trading as SimserviceHub.
          The words “you,” “your,” or “user” refer to you, as a user of the
          platform, whether you are a customer or a Artisan. Specific
          terms applicable to “customer,” “Artisan,” or “tradespeople” are
          identified as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.1.3 SimserviceHub operates the platform to introduce customers and
          tradespeople, acting as an intermediary that matches customers with
          tradespeople for home improvement, repair, and related services
          across Nigeria. Our responsibility is strictly limited to our role as
          operator of the platform. We are not responsible for the quality,
          standards, delivery, or any other aspect of the services rendered by
          any Artisan, nor for any agreement entered between a customer
          and a Artisan through the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.1.4 The platform offers a process for facilitating payments between
          customers and tradespeople for services. The payment service is
          provided by a third-party payment processor. While we facilitate this
          service, we are not responsible for the payment processor’s
          performance. If you encounter payment-related issues, our support
          team is available to assist you.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.1.5 Any personal information that you provide to us, or that we
          collect about you, will be handled in accordance with our Privacy
          Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.1.6 If you are a Artisan, the terms governing your use of
          payment services are outlined in the relevant Membership Terms and
          related agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.1.7 These Terms of Use (“Terms”) set out the rights and obligations
          of SimserviceHub, its customers, and tradespeople concerning platform
          usage. These Terms do not govern the contractual relationship between
          a customer and a Artisan for services. Any arrangement made
          between a Artisan and a customer is a separate contract to which
          SimserviceHub is not a party and bears no liability.
        </p>
        <p>

          of both customers and tradespeople using the platform. Please read

          <h3>4.1 Connecting Customers and Tradespeople</h3>

          <p>
            4.1.1 As a customer, if you choose to hire a Artisan via SimserviceHub, your contract for the services is
            directly with that Artisan. SimserviceHub facilitates the connection between customers and tradespeople
            but is not a party to any service agreement or contract. As such, SimserviceHub will not be held liable for any
            direct, indirect, or consequential loss or damage arising from, or in connection with, the service agreement or
            a customer’s decision to hire a Artisan through the platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.1.2 SimserviceHub uses a proprietary search ranking algorithm to match customers with tradespeople based on
            specific search criteria. The platform ensures fair distribution of matches using a variety of factors, such as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The quality and completeness of the Artisan’s profile.</li>
            <li>Customer reviews and ratings.</li>
            <li>Local supply and demand dynamics.</li>
            <li>The relevance of Artisan skills to the customer’s needs.</li>
            <li>Geographic proximity and environmental considerations.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For tradespeople, more details on how search ranking impacts visibility can be found in the Membership
            Agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.1.3 Customers are under no obligation to accept a quote from a Artisan sourced via the platform. The
            decision to proceed or decline is solely at the customer’s discretion.
          </p>

          <h3>4.2 Vetting</h3>

          <p>
            4.2.1 While SimserviceHub takes reasonable steps to verify the information provided by tradespeople, the data
            compiled on the platform is based on submissions from users and third parties. This information does not
            necessarily reflect the views of SimserviceHub, which cannot be held liable for inaccuracies or omissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.2.2 SimserviceHub undertakes a comprehensive vetting process to verify the credentials and business status of
            tradespeople registered on the platform. This includes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Reviewing feedback from customers through a structured monitoring process.</li>
            <li>
              Collecting recommendations from users to improve the reliability and reputation of tradespeople on the
              platform.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            4.2.3 The outcomes of vetting, monitoring, and recommendations are reflected in a Artisan’s profile to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Enhance accountability and transparency among tradespeople.</li>
            <li>Promote high standards of service, quality workmanship, and ethical practices.</li>
            <li>
              Enable customers to make informed hiring decisions while avoiding unscrupulous operators.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            4.2.4 As part of the vetting process, SimserviceHub requests proof of public liability insurance (PLI) from
            tradespeople. While efforts are made to monitor the validity of these insurance policies, the platform cannot
            guarantee that tradespeople maintain valid insurance between verification periods.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.2.5 In cases where SimserviceHub is notified of expired PLI coverage, a warning notice is displayed on the
            Artisan’s profile. However, customers are advised to independently verify a Artisan’s insurance
            status before work commences.

            binding in addition to the general Terms and Conditions.

            be disclosed to regulatory authorities as required by Nigerian law or for compliance purposes.
