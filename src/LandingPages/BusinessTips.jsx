            <strong>Use Social Media to Your Advantage:</strong> Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp are powerful tools for tradespeople. Post photos of your work, share customer testimonials, and respond to inquiries quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build a Local Presence:</strong> Connect with people in your area who may need your services. Use word-of-mouth marketing by offering discounts to clients who refer you to others.

        <h2>5. Expanding Your Business and Taking on More Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Consider Hiring Help:</strong> When you’re getting too many requests to handle alone, it might be time to hire assistants. This can help you take on more jobs without compromising on quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expand Your Services:</strong> Look for related services that you can offer to meet more of your clients’ needs. For example, if you’re a carpenter, you might offer basic home repairs as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Invest in Better Tools:</strong> As you grow, investing in better-quality tools can improve your efficiency and the quality of your work, which in turn boosts customer satisfaction.
