                <h2>Why Vetting Checks Are Essential</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trust and Safety:</strong> Homeowners and businesses need assurance that the tradesperson they hire are credible and trustworthy. Vetting helps build trust by ensuring that each tradesperson has a clean record and a positive background.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> By checking each tradesperson’s qualifications and experience, we ensure that only professionals with a proven track record are on our platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial Integrity:</strong> Vetting for financial stability reduces the risk of financial disputes or incomplete jobs due to unforeseen financial issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> Comprehensive background checks, such as adverse media and CCJ searches, reduce the risk of partnering with individuals with a history of legal or financial complications, ensuring a safe and reliable experience for all users.</li>
